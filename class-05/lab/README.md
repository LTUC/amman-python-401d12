# LAB-05: Pythonista

How Good Are You At Python? and how many features do you use to make your code readable simple and clean.

In this lab; you are going to test yourself and answer the previous question.

```let's get started.```

## Lab Requirements

> Create a repo and name it on GitHub ```Pythonista```.

> Add a behavior to a given function by using decorator to:

* Calculate the runtime of decorated function that needs to print ("I am a really good pythonista developer at ASAC").Make sure to add a way to make the function slower.

* Make a new chain of function decorators (bold, italic, underline etc.).

> Add two methods one for iterator and one for generator in your linkedList class.

* Write as a comment the difference between the generator and iterator that you conclude and what is the benefit of yield.

* Use ```comprehension list```.


> Use Dunder (Magic) Methods to your linkedList class as the following:
* Add ```__getitem__``` to allow linkedList to use the [] (indexer) operators method.
* Add ```__len__``` method to calculate the length of linkedList.
* Add ```__init__``` method to create an instance of the class.
* Add ```__str__``` method to convert a linkedList to a string .
* feel free to add more methods that first time you use.

> Add a formatted docstring for each function and print it.

> Update README and add your notes to it.
