# The Command Line
Tasks
Working as a tech professional will often involve interacting with the terminal on your computer.

This prework will introduce you to some of the more common commands involved in traversing directories and manipulating files on your computer.

## Submitting Your Work
For each of the following segments of [Bash Command Line Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) on ryanstutorials.net, completely read through and complete each of the activities in your own terminal. As you complete each segment’s activities, take a moment to document your learnings and observations.

- [The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php) - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.
- [Basic Navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php) - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.
- [More About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php) - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.
- [Manual Pages](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/manual.php) - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.
- [File Manipulation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/filemanipulation.php) - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.
- [Cheat Sheet](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php) - A quick reference for the main points covered in this tutorial.
When you are finished with all of the lessons, create a new entry in your reading notes repository summarizing your observations and learnings, highlighting things like your ‘ah hah’ moments or really interesting code snippets.

Please note: If you submit one-liners (i.e. “The permissions section talked about permissions. It was cool.”) you will not receive credit for this assignment.
