# Lab: Leveling up Front End with React, Next.js & TailwindCSS

## Overview

React is great! And though it does A LOT, it's not a full framework. In other words, many common tasks are not handled out of the box by React. So it's up to us devs to make some decisions about how to use React in combination with other tools.

One great "stack" is to use Next.js (which builds on top of React) and style with Tailwind.

Your job is to create a `Cookie Stand Admin` app using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/){:target="_blank"} and style using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/){:target="_blank"}.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- The `spec` for lab is screen shot of [Cookie Stand Admin Version 1](./cookie-stand-admin-version-1.png){:target="_blank"}
- `pages/Index.js` should...
  - Have `<Head>` component with page title set to `Cookie Stand Admin`
  - Have a `<header>` component that matches spec.
  - Have a `<main>` component containing `<form>` and a placeholder component showing JSON string of last created Cookie Stand.
  - Have a `<footer>` component that matches spec.
- Style app using TailwindCSS utility classes.

## Implementation Notes

- Initialize Next.js project with the following command.
> `npx create-next-app@latest --js --no-app`
- **NOTE**: there is no need to create a containing folder.
- Name your project `cookie-stand-admin`
- Accept defaults for remaining options.
- Strip out unused files
  - The app won't break if they get left in, but a good practice to remove stuff you're not using.
