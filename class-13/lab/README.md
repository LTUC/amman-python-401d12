# LAB-13: Liner Regression  

In this lab, you will examine relationships between two quantitative variables using a 
graphical tool called a `scatterplot`. 
You will interpret `scatterplots` in terms of form, direction, and 
strength of the relationship, and use it to assess the appropriateness of using a linear regression model to describe the relationship between the two variables. If appropriate, you can then perform a linear regression analysis to produce an estimated model that can be used to predict the value of the response `y` for a given value of the predictor `x`.

## Steps
1. Create new Notebook named Linear Regression on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
2. Click Share button and select Public access.
3. Chose one on this three Dataset.\
a. [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).\
b. [Diamonds Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/diamonds-prices).\
c. [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices).


   

## Lab Requirements
1. Add mark down sell that have your name, your major, and the name of your dataset.
2. Load the data you receive into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Show the first ten rows of the data set.
4. Show the description and the info of the data set.
5. Using a regression model, split your data into train and test portions.
6. Fit your training split to the regression model.
7. Show your regression model's score.
8. Use your train model to predict three different info about your dataset and print the result for predict and the real data of them from the dataset.


## Testing Requirements
- No test in this lab.
