# Create a Reading Notes Repo

If you don’t already have one, create a `reading-notes` repository on GitHub, where you can keep track of your observations and questions from the reading assignments throughout your course.

Think of it as a way to document and highlight your new knowledge. Publish it with GitHub pages, so it becomes a live web site.

## Setup and Documentation
Use these resources to get going:

- [Markdown on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [Getting Started with GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) 

## Requirements
1. If you have previously created this repo for another class, double-check to ensure it follows all guidelines here.
2. Your site should exist at `https://USERNAME.github.io/reading-notes/`
3. The “source” for your site should be a README.md file, written with Markdown
4. On the main page:
    - Include a level-1 heading titled `Reading Notes`
    - Include a description of what this web site is about
    - Include a level-2 heading for each course, ie:
        - `Code 102 - Intro to Software Development`
        - `Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development`
        - `Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development`
        - `Code 401 - Advanced Software Development`
5. Utilize at least 5 different features of Markdown to structure your page

## Submission Instructions
Submit the link to your reading notes repo, even if you have already done so for a previous class. Your grader will verify it is set up correctly for this course.
